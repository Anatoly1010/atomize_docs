<br/>
Atomize is used to control Q-band pulsed EPR spectrometer located in Novosibirsk Institute of Organic Chemistry. The general implementation is similar to that of the [X-band pulsed machine](/atomize_docs/pages/projects/xband), but a slightly different set of hardware is used. The spectrometer operates in 33.0-35.5 GHz frequency range, has a 200 W solid-state amplifier, a temporal resolution of 4 ns for mw pulses, and a 1.25 GS/s DAC for generating shaped microwave pulses.
